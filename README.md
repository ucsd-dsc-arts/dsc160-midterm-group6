## Abstract

For the members within our group and for countless others, rap has been a massive part of our lives; we see and hear it everywhere, constantly shaping today's culture. Newer rappers can be seen experimenting with new styles all the time as they try to break down the boundaries of music and create their own legacy within the industry. In fact, in recent years, rappers have gained a more direct influence on mainstream culture with their unprecedented levels of fame allowing them to collaborate with huge brands such as Travis Scott’s collaboration with Nike or Kanye West’s with Adidas. With all of these changes happening within rap culture, it only makes sense that this would have an affect on the genre of rap itself. All of our group members love to listen to rap music; however, we can all agree that the style and sound of rap has changed drastically throughout time. As such, we have decided to base our project around our favorite genre and to analyze its transition in style over the years. We are all curious as to what core differences exist between older and newer rap. Specifically, we will look at various rap songs from four separate decades, the 90’s, 00’s, 10’s and now.

To answer the question of how rap has changed over the past few decades, we will try to determine how rap has developed in the following two categories: beat/sound, and lyrics.  We will first establish whether there really is a significant sonical difference between the different eras of rap. This will mainly be explored through the use of mel spectrograms, which was demonstrated in class. Then, we will see if we can classify between old-school vs new-school rap. Since we as humans are able to hear the distinct differences in styles, we expect that our machine learning models will also be able to learn and distinguish between them. And, as we did in class, we will attempt to assess which machine learning algorithm is best for the classification task at hand and use that model to classify songs between the different eras of rap. However, rap music has not only changed in terms of how it sounds, but also in its subject matter and in the lyrics used as well. To illustrate this, we intend to create some graphs showing the difference in the usage of words. These graphs might include bar plots, word clouds, and other visualizations which we will use to clearly demonstrate the differences in styles. We hypothesize that old school rap is more lyrical, so we will try to calculate statistics to test the validity of this hypothesis. We will also try to decrease the number of confounding variables, so we will try to compare rap songs from specific geographical locations. Even people unfamiliar with hip hop are able to recognize that the rap that we listen to today is distinctly different from the rap that was popular in the last few decades. From the lyrics to the beat, the evolution of hip-hop is clearly evident, and we hope to be able to use our machine learning models to identify both the obvious and subtle changes that rap has undergone.


## Data

(10 points) 

This section will describe your data and its origins. Each item should contain a name of the data source, a link to the source, and any necessary background information such as:
- What is your cultural data source? 
- When was it made? 
- Who created the works? 
- Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

(20 points)

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for: 

- data acquisition/scraping
- cleaning
- analysis
- generating results. 

Link each of your notebooks or .py files within this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

(30 points) 

This section will contain links to documentation of your results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your domain of analysis. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally relevant?
- How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? 
- How do you think the original artists/musicians would respond to this type of analysis? Would it change/inform their practice in some way?
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
